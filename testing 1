# Simple Python Program

# Ask for user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the age in 50 years
age_in_50_years = age + 50

# Print the result
print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old now.")
print(f"In 5 years, you will be {age_in_50_years} years old.")
